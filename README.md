# XRR Attenuation Predictor for BMM #

This repo supports the development of a predictor function for
controlling an attenuator stack dynamically during an XRR measurement.

In `src/data/` there are several examples of XRR data taken over the
years at BMM.

In `src/notebooks` there is a Jupyter notebook showing an example of
importing and plotting one of the example data files.
